Hi, I am an 8th grader from Turkey. I have big goals and i am trying to achieve them. 
I can code Python, HTML, and CSS. I plan on learning JavaScript and C++. I plan on making games in the future. Because i want to make games i am learning Unity too. I am open for
job offers in making website and games. Thanks!
 My hobbies are doing art, doing Blender, watching movies, watching anime and most importantly learning. I only played games past years and learned Python 6 months ago but for
 the last 2 months i adopted a growth mindset because i realized i need to grow and survive in my own. So i plan on acing the exam we have in 8th grade and going to the best 
 school of my country. I only played games past years but my exams are actually very good. There is none below 85. So i believe if i work hard enough i can go to that school 
 i talked about. Good luck me
